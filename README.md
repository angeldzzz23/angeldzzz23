## Hey there, world! 🌍👋

I’m passionate about backend infrastructure, distributed systems, and iOS development, but I can handle the full stack when needed. When I’m not debugging something, you’ll probably find me running a marathon, training for an Ironman, or curating the perfect playlist.

### Projects i've built
Most of these are a mix of interesting side projects, companies I’ve built, client work I’ve done or companies i've worked for. For almost every project, I’ve been involved in every step of the process, ranging from the ideation (development of SRS/PRD) through design and actual development.
